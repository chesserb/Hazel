# Hazel
Hazel is an associative array library. I wrote it as a beginning point of a programming language I was working on before I realized how much time it would take to do. I still plan to finish the language, but this is at least a starting point.
Unfortunately:
## There are problems with deleting entries...
sometimes it will just get caught in an infinite loop as C code likes to do. If you find the problem or make a fix please let me know or submit it.
