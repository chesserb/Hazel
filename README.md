*All alone my watch I'm keeping,*  
*In the Hazel-Dell;*

Hazel is an associative array library. I wrote it as a beginning point of a programming language I was working on before I realized how much time it would take to make. I still hope to finish the language, but this is at least a starting point.  
Here you can find the [documentation](https://github.com/chesserb/Hazel/blob/master/documentation.md). Little as it may be, it's enough. This is a small library.  
  
Unfortunately:
## There are problems with deleting entries...
sometimes it will just get caught in an infinite loop as C code likes to do. If you find the problem or make a fix please let me know or submit it.
It does often work though. Isn't that the worst kind of bug... the one that taunts you from time to time, just enough to be a problem?  
If you don't want to delete entries the rest of the library should work just fine for you!
