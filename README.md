# Hazel

Hazel is an associative array library. I wrote it as a beginning point of a programming language I was working on before I realized how much time it would take to do. I still plan to finish the language, but this is at least a starting point.
Unfortunately:
## There are problems with deleting entries...
sometimes it will just get caught in an infinite loop as C code likes to do. If you find the problem or make a fix please let me know or submit it.
It does often work though. Isn't that the worst kind of bug... the one that taunts you from time to time, just enough to be a problem?
